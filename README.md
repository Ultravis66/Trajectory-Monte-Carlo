# Trajectory-Monte-Carlo

A small, reproducible simulation that couples closed-loop guidance (PN + pitch trim) with rigid-body dynamics (translation + quaternion attitude + MOI). Aerodynamics are from tabulated Cl/Cd with interpolation; pitching moments use 
Cm(Î±) + control + rate damping. Includes event-based ground impact, Monte Carlo targeting, and runtime reporting.
